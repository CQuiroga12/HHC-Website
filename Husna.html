            <h1> Helloo
            </h1>
            <H2>My name is Husnal Bhasin, but you can call me Husna.
                I'm 19 years old, haha wait actually I'm 20 from today (Feels so strange to say).
                I'm from New Delhi, India and I've been studying at Bryn Mawr College for the last two years.
                I plan to major in Econimics with minors in philosophy and sociology. 
                Currently my favourite color is green, and I'm staying with family in New York.
                I enjoy being creative and learning new things (reason why I'm here and spent all day yesterday fighting with github).

                Attaching my art portfolio here.

               Super excited to get to know you all.

               I also love capturing moments and click way too many photos
               Here are some pictures from last week which I spent with nyc with my younger twin brothers (I'm not tiny, my brothers are just very tall at 6'2 and 6'3).
