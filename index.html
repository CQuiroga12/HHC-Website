    <div> Hi! My name is Ha. I'm a rising senior at Agnes Scott College. I'm also an international student and my home country is Vietnam. My majors are Math and English Literature. In the future, I want to have a career in Data Science. In my free time, I love watching Netflix, reading manga, and drawing. I also really love cats and one fun fact about me is that I used to have ten cats at one point in my life. </div>
