        During my Spring Break in 2019, I went to Manchester, UK. 
        Here are some of my favorite photos and quotes from the trip:

    <p class="p3">Philadelphia Museum of Art</p>
    <p class="p4">This picture reminds me of our group’s one-day delay in Philadelphia before 
         arriving in Manchester. Although the delay was unpleasant, it was still a nice
         experience to explore Philadelphia.

    </div>
    <p class="p3">Manchester street and modern buildings</p>
    <p class="p4">This street is full of modern and beautiful buildings, which
        shows the great, present-day landscape of Manchester.
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="Assets/Images/ha3.jpeg" class= "one-img" alt="" srcset="">
    </div>
    <p class="p3">The “Baby”, the first computer to store and run the program 
        – Science and Industry Museum, Manchester, UK
    </p>
    <p class="p4">This machine illustrates the amazing growth of the scientific,
        industrial, and technological scene of Manchester. It is also interesting to see
        the start of the digital evolution, without which we could never had access to
        the great pool of information like today.

    <p class="p3">Eleanor Rigby Statue – Liverpool, UK
    </p>
    <p class="p4">
        This statue is based on the subject of the The Beatles’ song
        “Eleanor Rigby”. There was actually a headstone with the name Eleanor Rigby
        in a church fete where John Lennon and Paul McCartney first met.
    </p>
    <p class="p5">Some of the quotes said by UK locals and visitors:</p>
    <p class="p4">"Around 2013, a guy named Neil McArdle created a bomb hoax to prevent his 
        bride from knowing that he had forgotten to book their wedding venue." - 
        Trevor, our tour guide in Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p class="p4">“It is said that if you touch Eleanor Rigby statue, you will not be lonely anymore.”
        Trevor, our tour guide in Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p class="p4">“Oh, lemonade in the UK turns out to be Sprite with a slice of lemon.”
